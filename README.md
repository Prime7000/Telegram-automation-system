**Project Description: Telegram Automation Suite by Ofejiro Agbaduta Technology**  

Introducing the **Telegram Automation Suite**, a robust Python-based solution designed to streamline message scheduling and management for individuals and businesses. Developed by Ofejiro Agbaduta Technology, this software empowers users to automate Telegram messaging with unparalleled flexibility, reliability, and ease.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Schedule messages in **non-repeat** or **repeat** modes, with customizable intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly).  
- **Multi-Media Support**: Send text messages, images, and other supported file types seamlessly.  
- **24/7 Automation**: A dedicated Python script runs continuously, retrieving scheduled tasks from the database and executing them precisely at their designated times.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Django**, the platform offers an intuitive web-based dashboard for effortless task creation, editing, and monitoring.  
- **Database Reliability**: Utilizes **SQLite** for secure and efficient data storage, ensuring quick access to scheduled tasks and user preferences.  

**Technical Architecture:**  
The system leverages Django’s MVC framework to host a server that manages user interactions, task configuration, and real-time updates. The backend Python automation service operates independently, polling the database at regular intervals to fetch pending tasks and dispatch them via Telegram’s API. This decoupled design guarantees high performance and scalability.
